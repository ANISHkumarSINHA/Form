Multi-Step Form with Real-Time Collaboration
This project is a multi-step form built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (for state management), ShadCN UI (for UI components), and Framer Motion (for animations). The form has a smooth, interactive experience, with real-time collaboration features and a dark mode toggle.

Features:
Multi-Step Navigation: The form is split into multiple steps to make it easier for users to fill in their information.
Real-Time Updates: The form can simulate real-time collaboration with mock API integration.
Dark Mode Support: Switch between light and dark modes easily.
Smooth Animations: Transition between steps with smooth animations.
State Management: The form uses Zustand to manage state globally, making it efficient and dynamic.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive, works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Tech Stack:
Next.js: A powerful React framework for building static and dynamic websites.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
Zustand: A small, fast state management library for React.
ShadCN UI: A set of beautiful UI components to speed up development.
Framer Motion: A library for adding smooth animations and transitions.
Mock API: Simulated API endpoints to update the form in real time.
